# Excel_Project01
**Introduction**
I want to share what I’ve learned from Luke Barousse’s Excel for Data Analytics course. This project is based on his lessons, and I’m really grateful for the technical skills I’ve gained from him.
Thanks to Luke Barousse!

This is the outcome of the first project that I learned to him.
