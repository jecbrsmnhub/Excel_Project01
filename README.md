# Excel_Project01
📝 **Introduction**
Hello/Hi to whoever visits my repository! 👋

My name is Jerric Bersamin, and I live in the Philippines. My journey into data analytics started in the most unexpected way—just inputting customer data into a worksheet. One day, I decided to create a simple monthly dashboard using that data. 
That’s when I started wondering: Are there jobs out there related to Excel?

That curiosity led me to discover Data Analytics. Before this, my knowledge of Excel was almost nothing. Even the basic SUM function was unfamiliar to me—I only knew how to input data into a cell.
But as I kept exploring, I got more curious about what Excel could really do. I searched online for ways to autofill cells, do simple math, and use cell referencing. And that’s when everything changed.

What started as a small curiosity turned into a passion for learning more about data.

The purpose of this project is to show the KPI for job seekers to determine if they were compensated correctly for their desired job. The project uses various metrics to compare job compensation against industry standards, helping individuals understand if they’re being paid fairly.

  • This is the output of the project. (from Luke Barousse YT: Excel For Data Analytics)

📝 **Before the Project Started**
  • I learned so much from his lessons, including how to transfer datasets to another worksheet or workbook, as well as exploring the ribbons, formulas, and functions.

📝  **"What I love the most are:**

  ✅ LOOKUP function
  ✅ Statistical functions (along with Array Formulas)
  ✅ Logical functions (IF)
  ✅ Creating Visualization through Chart
  • I really focused on these chapters, as I know they are crucial for manipulating the data.

- (Not done yet.) Will continue the story of my progress... 😊😊
